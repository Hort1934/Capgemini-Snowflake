### **Project: Snowflake ETL Pipeline for Airbnb Data**

**Overview**

This project demonstrates an ETL pipeline using Snowflake to automate the process of ingesting, transforming, and loading Airbnb data from a local CSV file. The pipeline leverages Snowflake features such as Snowpipe, Snowflake Streams, Tasks, and Time Travel to ensure efficient and reliable data management.

**Prerequisites**

* A Snowflake account
* SnowSQL CLI installed
* The `AB_NYC_2019.csv` file uploaded to a cloud storage bucket

**Steps**

1. **Create Snowflake Environment:**
   * Create a database named `nyc_airbnb`.
   * Create a warehouse for executing SQL queries.

2. **Ingest Data:**
   * Use Snowpipe to continuously ingest CSV files from the cloud storage bucket into a Snowflake stage.
   * Set up Streams to track changes in the data for incremental loads.

3. **Create Tables:**
   * Create a raw table to store the ingested data.
   * Create a transformed table for cleaned and processed data.

4. **Transform Data:**
   * Clean and transform the data using Snowflake SQL:
     * Filter out invalid price data.
     * Convert dates and handle missing values.
     * Drop rows with missing location data.

5. **Load Transformed Data:**
   * Insert the transformed data into the `transformed` table.

6. **Implement Data Quality Checks:**
   * Use Streams to monitor changes in both tables.
   * Implement checks to validate data integrity.

7. **Automate with Tasks:**
   * Create a Snowflake Task to schedule the ETL process daily.

8. **Error Handling and Monitoring:**
   * Use Time Travel to recover from errors.
   * Implement error handling and monitoring mechanisms.

**Files**

* `etl_pipeline.sql`: The SQL script containing the ETL pipeline.
* `snowpipe_config.json`: The Snowpipe configuration file.

**Usage**

1. Configure the Snowpipe configuration file with your cloud storage bucket details.
2. Run the `etl_pipeline.sql` script to execute the ETL process.
3. Use the Snowflake UI or SnowSQL to monitor the pipeline's progress and results.

**Additional Notes**

* Consider optimizing the ETL process for performance.
* Implement additional data validation and quality checks as needed.
* Explore Snowflake's advanced features for more complex data management scenarios.
